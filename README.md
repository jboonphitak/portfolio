# John Boonphitak - Data Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm John! I come from a background in sales and operations, with over 10 years of experience as a founder and high-volume sales professional. Along the way, I developed a deep interest in data—how it drives decisions, reveals trends, and enables smarter business strategies.

I’ve built a strong foundation in data analysis, sales conversion, and CRM systems like Salesforce (currently pursuing my Salesforce Administrator certification). I enjoy working with Excel, Tableau, and SQL to uncover insights that support strategic problem-solving and operational efficiency.

Previously, as a restaurant owner and real estate sales leader, I gained hands-on experience in inventory management, workflow automation, and vendor negotiations—areas where data played a key role in improving outcomes. These experiences sharpened my ability to identify patterns, solve problems, and create scalable systems.

In my free time, I’m constantly exploring new data tools and building projects to sharpen my skills. Whether collaborating with a team or working independently, I’m driven by the challenge of turning raw data into meaningful insights.

This repository showcases my projects, tracks my learning progress, and highlights the intersection of sales, operations, and data analytics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie
**Code:** [`Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie.ipynb`](https://github.com/tiannaparris/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Analyzing%20the%20Factors%20Contributing%20to%20the%20Success%20of%20a%20Movie.ipynb)

**Goal:** To determine what factors contribute the most to a movie's success.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of movies released between 1980 and 2022. The dataset included movie titles, ratings, genres, release dates, budgets, gross earnings, and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between budget and gross earnings, and implemented Pearson’s correlation statistical analysis.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Results:** Using Python functions the analysis revealed that votes and budget have the highest correlation with gross earnings, while the company has no significant correlation.

### Covid 19 Data Exploration
**Code:** [`COVID Portfolio Project.sql`](https://github.com/tiannaparris/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/COVID%20Portfolio%20Project.sql)

**Description:** The dataset contains records of Covid-19 cases, deaths and vaccine records by country in 2020-2021. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing and EDA (exploratory data analysis).

**Skills:** Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

**Technology:** SQL Server
